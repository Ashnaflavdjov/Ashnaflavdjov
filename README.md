## Welcome to my profile!

I am **Ashnaflavdjov**, I started learning Java in 2021 but soon fell in love with web development.

## 🛠️ Technologies I use:

- Java.
- JavaScript.
- NodeJS.
- ReactJS.
- NextJS.
- Unity C#.
- Lua.
- MySQL.
- PostgreSQL.

## 📖 Currently learning more about:

- NextJS.
- C# and .Net core.

## 🤔 My next steps:

- Go back to Rust as I liked the language.
- Start using TypeScript instead of JavaScript.
- Create more projects that require Sockets as I find it fun to play with.
